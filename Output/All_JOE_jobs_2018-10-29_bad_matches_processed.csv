This 3 year postdoc position is part of a project funded by an Advanced Grant from the European Research Council, focusing on the development of a new generation of discrete choice models <U+2013> so called generalized entropy models <U+2013> that can be used to predict consumer demand in complex settings.  
 
The position is offered from 1 February 2019 or earlier. 
 
The postdoc project must fit into the agenda of developing generalized entropy models. This is a new kind of micro-econometric model that is relevant for modelling consumer demand in the form of discrete choices or market shares. Initial papers on generalized entropy are:  

    Fosgerau, de Palma, Monardo (2018) Demand Models for Differentiated Products with Complementarity and Substitutability 
    Fosgerau, Melo, de Palma, Shum (2018) Discrete Choice and Rational Inattention: A General Equivalence Result 

The post doc project should extend this line of research, focusing on the development and structural estimation of discrete choice demand models based on generalized entropy as well as their empirical application. The concept of generalized entropy is new; hence the project will be path-breaking in this respect.

Position Summary:
Cornell University's Department of Policy Analysis and Management (PAM) in the College of Human Ecology (CHE) invites applications for a dynamic, visionary leader to serve as Chair. The Department consists of 29 tenure track faculty spanning multiple disciplines with strong depth in economics, sociology, and demography. The Department offers a wide range of programs at all degree levels, and the Chair position presents an opportunity for a scholar to play a key role in supporting and elevating the social sciences and public policy in CHE and Cornell University more broadly. PAM serves as a hub for teaching in public policy, currently offering a large undergraduate major in Policy Analysis and Management, a Masters in Health Administration (the Sloan Program), and a PhD in Policy Analysis and Management. PAM is launching a new undergraduate major in Health Care and Policy and contributes to teaching in the professional MPA degree offered by the Cornell Institute for Public Affairs (CIPA). The Department has strong ties with schools and departments across Cornell, and faculty lend their expertise to several graduate fields, including Economics, Sociology, Public Affairs, Industrial and Labor Relations (ILR), and Demography. The Department also has close connections with and provides leadership to multidisciplinary centers and institutes across campus, with PAM faculty leading and playing significant roles in the Cornell Population Center, the Institute for Social Sciences, the Bronfenbrenner Center for Translational Research (BCTR), and CIPA.

PAM faculty are exceptional in their research productivity. According to Academic Analytics, the faculty in PAM ranked 5th in overall productivity among the 79 public policy programs included in the analysis. PAM's annual operating budget for 2017-2018 was $9.6 million, including 77 percent from CHE and 23 percent from grants, contracts, federal appropriations, restricted gifts, and endowment income.

The next Chairperson will be an internationally known scholar with the ability to be strategic and visionary about PAM's future opportunities, who can build on the positive trajectory that PAM has established since its inception twenty years ago. The candidate will need a scholarly record commensurate with tenure at the full professor level and the ability to balance administration, research, teaching, and public engagement.

Princeton University is pleased to announce the call for applications to the Fung Global Fellows Program at the Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies (PIIRS).  Each year the program selects six scholars from around the world to be in residence at Princeton for an academic year and to engage in research and discussion around a common theme.  Candidates will be considered in three categories:  (1) Four of the fellowships will be awarded to early-career scholars employed in the equivalent of tenure-track positions who are expected to return to their position. (2)  One fellowship is set aside for a postdoctoral research associate who at the time of application does not have a tenure-track faculty appointment.  (3) In addition, one fellowship will be awarded to a senior scholar.  All candidates must be based outside the United States.

During the academic year 2019-20, the Fung Global Fellows Program theme will be <U+201C>Thinking Globally.<U+201D>  How people have thought about the planet has informed the institutions, norms, and policies that have pulled it together and torn it apart.  For centuries, ideas of free trade, human rights or global governance have framed cooperation and competition, order and disorder.  Such ideas have also spawned border-crossing movements, from campaigns to end slavery to commitments to reduce carbon emissions.  In turn, global thinking and action have often reinforced commitments to national ideas and efforts to curb global exchange.  The goal of this research theme is to explore how ideas framed the understanding of interests and the making of institutions that have yielded commonness and conflict across and within borders.  We also want to understand how these ideas and practices came into being through scientific networks, foundations, and think tanks.  The Program will also examine rival world ideas that have challenged prevailing orthodoxies.  Nowadays, with cooperative norms under challenge, global institutions under stress, and a century of guiding ideas about global convergence in doubt, we want to take a broad look at where these ideas came from, their effects, and the prospects for intellectual renewal or rethinking.  The goal of the 2019-20 Fung Global Fellows cohort will be to explore the ways people learned to rely on or to reject strangers far away, as well as to imagine how global relationships came to be and could be different.  We welcome applicants from all disciplinary and inter-disciplinary fields from the sciences to the humanities whose work addresses this set of themes in any historical period or world region.

Applications are due on November 9, 2018.  All candidates must reside outside the United States. To be eligible, postdoctoral applicants must have completed all requirements for their Ph.D. before August 1, 2019 but cannot have received their degrees more than three years prior to the start of the appointment on September 1, 2019.  Early-career fellows must have received their Ph.D. or equivalent no earlier than September 1, 2009.  Senior scholars, who have received their doctorates before 2009, must have faculty appointments and a record of scholarly accomplishment in the designated theme of the program.  Fellowships will be awarded on the strength of a candidate<U+2019>s proposed research project, the relationship of the project to the program theme, the candidate<U+2019>s scholarly record, and the ability to contribute to the intellectual life of the program.

Interdisciplinary: Permanent researchers include top scholars in anthropology, applied mathematics, biology, communications, computer science, economics, law, machine learning, physics, psychology, sociology and statistics, physics. Postdoctoral researchers in past years have collaborated extensively across disciplinary boundaries with great success and we expect attention to such interdisciplinary research to grow further as economics and computer science become more tightly integrated as fields.

Fields: We are particularly interested in candidates with expertise in auctions and market design, platform economics, industrial organization, machine learning, personnel economics, social networks analysis, behavioral economics, economics of digitization and e-commerce and applied game theory. However, exceptional candidates in all fields will receive full consideration and interdisciplinary candidates with backgrounds in any of the above-listed interdisciplinary fields are warmly welcomed.

Cornerstone Research is a leading economic and financial consulting firm with more than 700 staff members across eight offices. Together with an extensive network of internationally prominent faculty, we conduct rigorous, objective research applying the highest standards from  academia  to  address  complex  financial,  economic,  accounting,  and  marketing  issues  that  arise  in  litigation  and  regulatory investigation.

Cornerstone Research is involved in a broad variety of high-profile legal cases and disputes. Current matters focus on such topics as capital markets, business and securities valuation, M&A and corporate events, risk management, market competition, high frequency trading, the impact of marketing on consumers, and patent infringement. For example, we address issues affecting the ongoing development of financial markets, such as applying frameworks at the intersection of finance and industrial organization economics to evaluate price setting in derivative markets. Beyond the financial markets, we address financial economics issues arising in a range of sectors, from such innovation-driven industries as life sciences and high technology to energy, telecommunications, and industrial markets. We address economic  issues  when  evaluating  potential  mergers,  claims  of  anticompetitive  conduct,  and  the  impact  of  intellectual  property infringement. We also address marketing and economic issues arising in cases with allegations of misleading marketing or false claims. More detail can be found on our website at www.cornerstone.com.

Summer Associate at Cornerstone Research
Cornerstone Research offers candidates pursuing doctoral studies in finance, economics, econometrics, accounting, or marketing the opportunity to join the firm for six to twelve weeks to gain first-hand experience in our work in the role of a Summer Associate. The role is designed to mirror the experience of a first-year Associate and includes case assignments as well as formal training.

Summer Associates work closely with senior staff, clients, and experts to define objectives, guide research efforts, manage deadlines and mentor junior staff. Daily responsibilities typically include assisting with developing project strategy, conducting research, directing analysis, understanding and summarizing data and key findings, and proposing effective solutions to problems faced by their teams. This is a great opportunity for doctoral candidates to use theoretical and empirical research skills gained through their graduate-level training to devise and apply innovative and rigorous analytical approaches to interesting real-world issues. The outcomes of our cases can have a direct and immediate impact on public policy and corporate strategy.

While many Summer Associates choose to spend their summer with us, the timing and duration of this position is flexible and can be arranged any time over the summer or during the academic year.

Candidate Profile
We seek candidates who are pursuing doctoral studies in finance, economics, econometrics, accounting, or marketing, and who have graduated or will be graduating in 2020 or 2021. Candidates must have the ability to apply academic research to real-world issues. We are currently hiring in our Boston, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Silicon Valley (Menlo Park, CA), New York, San Francisco, and Washington, DC offices. We will be interviewing at our local offices on a rolling basis.
