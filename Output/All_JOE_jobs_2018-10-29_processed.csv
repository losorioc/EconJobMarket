Entry level economists do not require a background in banking research or experience in the banking industry. Mid-career and senior economists are expected to have experience in economics, banking, or finance. 

Financial Economists balance independently generated scholarly research with policy work. Research generally focuses on banking, finance, risk measurement, deposit insurance, and systemic risk, among other topics. Research is disseminated in peer-reviewed academic, industry, professional, and FDIC journals, publications, and conferences. The FDIC has an active seminar series and economists have access to a wide range of proprietary data. The FDIC supports the Center for Financial Research (CFR) which organizes conferences, sponsors visiting scholars, and undertakes other activities that support the agency<U+2019>s research mission (visit https://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/cfr/ for more information). In addition, economists support agency functions in several ways. For example, they review quantitative models used by banks for measuring financial risks such as credit, interest rate, and operational risk; they develop and maintain quantitative models to support FDIC functions, including deposit insurance pricing, deposit insurance fund management, stress testing, and the resolution of banks in the least costly manner. Economists also perform policy-focused research on current topics such as the effects of post-crisis banking reforms on bank behavior and systemic risk, the costs and benefits of differing approaches to resolving a failed bank, and small business lending.

The FDIC is an Equal Opportunity Employer. US citizenship is required for this position.

Working as a Researcher at Vanguard 

Day-to-day work life. Day to day, the work of a researcher at Vanguard is centered on current research projects, including collaboration with members of their immediate workgroup as well as with others across the organization. Depending on the role, researchers are also called upon to speak either externally with clients, the media, industry groups, or policymakers, or internally with fellow crewmembers. Researchers may also serve as subject matter experts to business leaders and to business project teams throughout the organization. We value research expertise, as well as the ability to speak cogently and clearly about one<U+2019>s area of specialization and interest.

Proprietary research v. academic collaboration. Much of the research work undertaken at Vanguard is proprietary in nature.

At the same time, there are also opportunities for research professionals to pursue collaborations with academic partners in their area of professional interest. Vanguard encourages its professional staff to establish a national or global reputation in their field of expertise. While not a job requirement, external research collaborations can help advance this objective.

The Census Bureau provides an excellent environment for empirically-oriented economists to use confidential microdata on businesses and households, linked employer-employee data, and confidential microdata from federal and state administrative and statistical agencies to conduct research on a wide range of topics. These topics include business dynamics (industrial organization, productivity, trade, entrepreneurship, innovation); labor dynamics (employment, worker flows); income dynamics (earnings, taxation, assets, poverty, program participation); health (disability, health status, insurance markets); and household dynamics (family structure, education, migration). 

Economists' activities include presenting analytical and methodological research at professional conferences; publishing in scholarly journals; writing descriptive reports for the public; maintaining and improving data collection; and responding to inquiries from Congress, the press, and the public on topics of interest. Experience with firm-, household-, and/or industry-level data is especially valued, as are skills in data manipulation, analysis, and big data techniques. U.S. citizenship is required. Positions are subject to budgetary approval. The Census Bureau is an equal opportunity employer. Please submit materials using the JOE application.
