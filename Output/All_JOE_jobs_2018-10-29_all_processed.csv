This 3 year postdoc position is part of a project funded by an Advanced Grant from the European Research Council, focusing on the development of a new generation of discrete choice models <U+2013> so called generalized entropy models <U+2013> that can be used to predict consumer demand in complex settings.  
 
The position is offered from 1 February 2019 or earlier. 
 
The postdoc project must fit into the agenda of developing generalized entropy models. This is a new kind of micro-econometric model that is relevant for modelling consumer demand in the form of discrete choices or market shares. Initial papers on generalized entropy are:  

    Fosgerau, de Palma, Monardo (2018) Demand Models for Differentiated Products with Complementarity and Substitutability 
    Fosgerau, Melo, de Palma, Shum (2018) Discrete Choice and Rational Inattention: A General Equivalence Result 

The post doc project should extend this line of research, focusing on the development and structural estimation of discrete choice demand models based on generalized entropy as well as their empirical application. The concept of generalized entropy is new; hence the project will be path-breaking in this respect.

Princeton University is pleased to announce the call for applications to the Fung Global Fellows Program at the Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies (PIIRS).  Each year the program selects six scholars from around the world to be in residence at Princeton for an academic year and to engage in research and discussion around a common theme.  Candidates will be considered in three categories:  (1) Four of the fellowships will be awarded to early-career scholars employed in the equivalent of tenure-track positions who are expected to return to their position. (2)  One fellowship is set aside for a postdoctoral research associate who at the time of application does not have a tenure-track faculty appointment.  (3) In addition, one fellowship will be awarded to a senior scholar.  All candidates must be based outside the United States.

During the academic year 2019-20, the Fung Global Fellows Program theme will be <U+201C>Thinking Globally.<U+201D>  How people have thought about the planet has informed the institutions, norms, and policies that have pulled it together and torn it apart.  For centuries, ideas of free trade, human rights or global governance have framed cooperation and competition, order and disorder.  Such ideas have also spawned border-crossing movements, from campaigns to end slavery to commitments to reduce carbon emissions.  In turn, global thinking and action have often reinforced commitments to national ideas and efforts to curb global exchange.  The goal of this research theme is to explore how ideas framed the understanding of interests and the making of institutions that have yielded commonness and conflict across and within borders.  We also want to understand how these ideas and practices came into being through scientific networks, foundations, and think tanks.  The Program will also examine rival world ideas that have challenged prevailing orthodoxies.  Nowadays, with cooperative norms under challenge, global institutions under stress, and a century of guiding ideas about global convergence in doubt, we want to take a broad look at where these ideas came from, their effects, and the prospects for intellectual renewal or rethinking.  The goal of the 2019-20 Fung Global Fellows cohort will be to explore the ways people learned to rely on or to reject strangers far away, as well as to imagine how global relationships came to be and could be different.  We welcome applicants from all disciplinary and inter-disciplinary fields from the sciences to the humanities whose work addresses this set of themes in any historical period or world region.

Applications are due on November 9, 2018.  All candidates must reside outside the United States. To be eligible, postdoctoral applicants must have completed all requirements for their Ph.D. before August 1, 2019 but cannot have received their degrees more than three years prior to the start of the appointment on September 1, 2019.  Early-career fellows must have received their Ph.D. or equivalent no earlier than September 1, 2009.  Senior scholars, who have received their doctorates before 2009, must have faculty appointments and a record of scholarly accomplishment in the designated theme of the program.  Fellowships will be awarded on the strength of a candidate<U+2019>s proposed research project, the relationship of the project to the program theme, the candidate<U+2019>s scholarly record, and the ability to contribute to the intellectual life of the program.

The Bolin Fellowships are two-year residencies at Williams, and two scholars or artists are appointed each year. Fellows devote the bulk of the first year to the completion of dissertation work<U+2014>or in the case of MFA applicants, building their professional portfolios<U+2014>while also teaching one course as a faculty member in one of the College<U+2019>s academic departments or programs. The second year of residency (ideally with degree in hand) is spent on academic career development while again teaching just one course. Thus, this is a two-year appointment, ideally one pre-doctoral and one post-doctoral year, with a one course teaching load each year.

We are economists, statisticians, operations researchers, and computer scientists who combine theoretical insight with rigorous data analysis to maximize value created across Uber<U+2019>s real-time marketplace.  Economists at Uber have the opportunity to work on teams across the company in a variety of roles; we will direct hires to roles matching their interests and abilities.

The Marketplace Optimization team tackles problems like optimizing Uber<U+2019>s dynamic pricing engine; optimizing dispatches of drivers to incoming requests; developing and testing incentive schemes for drivers and riders; matching riders for UberPool; structuring menus and predicting orders for UberEATS; and improving understanding of rider and driver behavior through thoughtful experimentation.  They guide product decisions and enhance the algorithms that operate Uber's worldwide marketplace and work side-by-side with Uber's engineering team to scale out your ideas across Uber's real-time production systems.

The Economic Research team, under the Chief Economist, Jonathan Hall, is responsible for research on the dynamics of Uber and its interactions with labor markets and cities.  The Business Economics team uses such research to inform business strategy, operations, and product decisions.  For instance, we know that the flexible work model is very valuable to Uber drivers (see Chen et al., Angrist et al.) and that dynamic pricing is vital in protecting the health and efficiency of the dispatch market (see Castillo et al.); however, it<U+2019>s likely that consistency (e.g., of pricing or earnings) also carries some value for riders and drivers.  What values should we put on these opposing virtues, and how should we alter the product to reflect them?  The Policy Economics team uses research to inform policy decisions and to explain Uber to policy makers and the public.  They have ongoing projects with top academics on safety/quality, discrimination, labor market dynamics, occupational licensing, and transportation systems in developing cities.

- PhD in economics/econometrics

Mid-career and senior economists are expected to have experience in economics, banking, or finance. 

Financial Economists balance independently generated scholarly research with policy work. Research generally focuses on banking, finance, risk measurement, deposit insurance, and systemic risk, among other topics. Research is disseminated in peer-reviewed academic, industry, professional, and FDIC journals, publications, and conferences. The FDIC has an active seminar series and economists have access to a wide range of proprietary data. The FDIC supports the Center for Financial Research (CFR) which organizes conferences, sponsors visiting scholars, and undertakes other activities that support the agency<U+2019>s research mission (visit https://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/cfr/ for more information). In addition, economists support agency functions in several ways. For example, they review quantitative models used by banks for measuring financial risks such as credit, interest rate, and operational risk; they develop and maintain quantitative models to support FDIC functions, including deposit insurance pricing, deposit insurance fund management, stress testing, and the resolution of banks in the least costly manner. Economists also perform policy-focused research on current topics such as the effects of post-crisis banking reforms on bank behavior and systemic risk, the costs and benefits of differing approaches to resolving a failed bank, and small business lending.

Vanguard research is either applied to the development of proprietary investment strategies or published and disseminated to a range of external parties, which may include, depending on the topic, individual investors, institutional clients, the consulting community, the media and policymakers. It is our goal to deepen the quality of insights conveyed to the marketplace through our proprietary research.

At the same time, there are also opportunities for research professionals to pursue collaborations with academic partners in their area of professional interest. Vanguard encourages its professional staff to establish a national or global reputation in their field of expertise. While not a job requirement, external research collaborations can help advance this objective.  

Location. In the U.S., PhD-level roles are located at Vanguard<U+2019>s corporate headquarters in Malvern, Pennsylvania. (There are also occasional opportunities in our offices in Melbourne, Australia, and in London, United Kingdom.) Malvern is located in Chester County, approximately 25 miles west of the city of Philadelphia. The area is known for its high quality of life and its cultural amenities.  There is also easy access by rail or car to Philadelphia and to cities and resorts on the U.S. Eastern seaboard, including New York and Washington.

Excellent research skills and strong presentation skills are needed, as well as an ability to analyze complex policy issues quickly. Senior Economists participate actively in the policy process, represent the CEA in interagency meetings, and have primary responsibility for the economic analysis and reports prepared by the Council. 

Staff economists and Economists typically have Master<U+2019>s degrees and may be working on their Ph.D., taking leave from top programs for an academic year, and are integral members of the CEA team. They conduct advanced statistical analysis, contribute to reports distributed throughout the Administration and to Congress, and play a key role in producing CEA output. 

The CEA needs specialists in virtually every field of economics. Economists must be U.S. citizens and go through a security clearance.
